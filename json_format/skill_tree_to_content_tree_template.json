Title/description on separate line(s) above the URL (keep it short)\n2. One blank line\n3. URL must be raw, starting at column 1 (no bullets, no numbering, no indentation, no leading/trailing characters)\n4. URL must be on its own line with no other text\n5. One blank line after the URL\n\nExample:\nIntroduction to Python basics\nOfficial tutorial covering syntax and core concepts\n\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html\n\nNext source title here...\n\nProhibited:\n- Do NOT use markdown link syntax like [Title](URL)\n- Do NOT wrap URLs in parentheses, quotes, backticks, or code blocks\n- Do NOT place any text on the same line as a URL\n- Do NOT use bullets, numbering, or indentation before URLs\n- Do NOT output search queries or 'look up...' instructions\n- Do NOT invent URLs. Only include sources you are confident exist and are directly accessible\n\nSources must be immediately usable for learning (YouTube videos/playlists, targeted documentation pages, practical articles, labs, notebooks)\n</sources_non_negotiable>\n\n<source_quality_and_cost>\n- Prioritize the most practical, high-signal resources for fast learning in this {context}\n- Prefer free resources first when quality is comparable\n- Paid MOOCs/courses are allowed but MUST be de-prioritized; include them only when they are clearly superior or uniquely comprehensive, and label them as 'Paid' in the note\n- Avoid low-quality SEO content; prefer official docs, reputable educators, and established publishers\n- Prefer sources with hands-on steps, examples, and demonstrated workflows over purely conceptual overviews\n</source_quality_and_cost>\n\n<ordering>\n- Order sections and micro-skills by learning progression AND by impact for success in {context}\n- Use Impact (%) if present as a signal, but respect prerequisites\n</ordering>\n\n<parts_system>\nEnabled: true\nMax numbered items per part: {max_items_per_part}\nCounting rule: Only numbered items count toward the limit (1., 1.1, 1.2, ...).
