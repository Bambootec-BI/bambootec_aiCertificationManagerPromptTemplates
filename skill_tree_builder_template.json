Then expand depth and scope according to inputs.level.\n\n- If inputs.level implies beginner/entry-level: focus on the essential/common workflow; exclude expert-only optimizations and rare edge cases\n- If inputs.level implies intermediate: include common robustness and performance patterns; include a small set of context-relevant edge cases\n- If inputs.level implies expert: include expert-level optimizations, deeper debugging/diagnostics, and context-relevant edge cases and tradeoffs\n- If inputs.level is ambiguous: default to 'entry-level production' scope unless the level explicitly requests advanced/expert coverage\n</level_scaling>\n\n<coverage_requirements>\n<must_include>\n- Workflow basics (where work happens, how changes apply, how outputs are produced)\n- Inputs and access (setup, permissions/credentials if applicable)\n- Core operations (the main actions people do in this skill)\n- Combining or integrating parts (if applicable)\n- Quality checks (common errors, validation, sanity checks)\n- Safety/governance (privacy, security, compliance, safe defaults)\n- Performance/reliability basics (avoid obvious slow/brittle patterns)\n- Handoff readiness (naming, structure, minimal documentation)\n- Production use (run/deploy behavior in {inputs.context}, if applicable)\n</must_include>\n\n<exclude>\n- Expert-only optimizations when inputs.level is entry-level\n- Deep theory not required for {inputs.level}\n- Rare edge cases unless inputs.level is expert or the context makes them common\n</exclude>\n</coverage_requirements>\n\n<output_format>\n<output_1>\nType: Markdown table\nTitle: Skill Index (Textbook Style)\nColumns:\n- Learning Order\n- Section\n- Skill Title\n- Impact (%)\n- Why this matters (short, simple)\n</output_1>\n\n<output_2>\nType: Hierarchical skill tree\nFormat: Nested markdown list\nRequirements:\n- Two levels only\n- Ordered by learning progression\n- Looks like a textbook index\n- Impact shown per skill\n- Matches the table\n</output_2>\n</output_format>"
